The dashboard answer's the following key questions:
1.	Income vs Expenses – How much am I earning compared to how much I spend?
2.	Category Spend – Which expense categories consume the most money (e.g., Living, Discretionary, Transport)?
3.	Sub-Category Spend – Which specific items or services (e.g., Rent, Groceries, Doctor) drive my expenses?
4.	Account Usage – What percentage of expenses are paid from Checking vs Credit?
5.	Monthly Trend – How does my net income vary month to month?
6.	Charity & Discretionary Spending – How much do I allocate to optional or goodwill expenses?
7.	Expense Changes – Which categories have increased or decreased compared to the previous period?

3.	Data Categorization
    
    o	Assign each transaction to major categories (Living Expenses, Discretionary, Transport, etc.) and sub-categories.

4.	Dashboard Development
	
    o	Use a visualization tool in Excel to create KPI cards, charts, and filters (month, year).
  
    o	Include visual breakdowns such as:

 ##### Pie chart for account spend split
  ##### Bar charts for category and sub-category spending
  ##### Income vs Expense comparison
  ##### Monthly net income trends
  	
5.	Analysis
	
  o	Compare results across months and years.
    
  o	Identify problem areas and opportunities for savings.
